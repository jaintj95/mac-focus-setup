# Philosophy
* Minimize distractions – cut out the noise and focus on the signal.
* Pick your battles – you don’t need to apply every tweak in this guide; choose the ones that work best for you.

# Dock 
* Set to auto-hide to avoid distracting icons. You only focus on the current app window.

# Slack
* Disable notification counter on App icon: System settings -> Notifications -> Slack -> toggle "Badge Application Icon" to off
* Don't miss important notifications: Add managers/leads and important team members to VIP list and check "Always allow notifications from VIPs"
* Notifications: Uncheck "Notify me about replies to threads I'm following" -> You'll still receive unread threads alert within the app but they won't distract you on desktop.
* Sidebar optimization: Create sections for unimportant/muted channels and move these sections to the bottom (Below DMs.)

* For Sections that are unimportant: Click on individual sections and set them to show "Mentions only"

* Set notifications to display as a persistent banner instead of auto-dismissed alerts: this ensures all your critical messages are "Sticky" - after configuring all the changes listed here, you'll only see critical notifications and you don't want them to be auto-dismissed.

* Distraction free UI: Slack app -> Preferences -> Messages & Media -> Theme -> Compact
  * Note - It takes a while to get used to this view. Keep at it and you'll adjust to it in a week or two.

* Hardcore mode: Preferences -> Accessibility -> Simplified Layout Mode


# [Alt-Tab app switcher](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) 
* Override mac app switcher by setting Alt-Tab shortcut to command instead of ctrl
* Add Slack, Spotify and other non-essential apps to blacklists -> App switcher only shows what you really need for work -> You can still open/switch to these apps using Raycast or Spotlight. The added friction stops you from feeding your "doom-switching" impulses
* Set controls to only display windows from Current Space, Hide hidden windows

# Spotify (advanced users only)
* Set up [Spotify Player TUI](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/tree/master)
