# Dock 
* Set to auto-hide to avoid distracting icons. You only focus on the current app window.

# Slack
* Disable notification counter on App icon: System settings -> Notifications -> Slack -> Badge Application Icon
* Distraction free view for all messages: Slack app -> Preferences -> Messages & Media -> Theme -> Compact
* How not to miss important notifications: Add managers/leads and important team members to VIP list and check "Always allow notifications from VIPs"
* Notifications: Uncheck "Notify me about replies to threads I'm following" -> You'll still receive unread threads alert within the app but you won't receive distracting notifications on desktop.


# Alt-Tab app
* Override mac app switcher by setting Alt-Tab shortcut to command instead of ctrl
* Add Slack, Spotify and other non-essential apps to blacklists -> App switcher only shows what you really need for work
* Set controls to only display windows from Current Space, Hide hidden windows
