# Philosophy
* Minimise distractions - cut out all the noise and focus on the signal
* Pick and choose - you don't have to make all the adjustments listed below. Pick your poison. 

# Dock 
* Set to auto-hide to avoid distracting icons. You only focus on the current app window.

# Spotify (advanced users only)
* Set up [Spotify Player TUI](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/tree/master) 

# Slack
* Disable notification counter on App icon: System settings -> Notifications -> Slack -> toggle "Badge Application Icon" to off
* Don't miss important notifications: Add managers/leads and important team members to VIP list and check "Always allow notifications from VIPs"

* Distraction free view for all messages: Slack app -> Preferences -> Messages & Media -> Theme -> Compact
  * Note - It takes a while to get used to this view. Keep at it and you'll adjust to it in a week or two.

* Notifications: Uncheck "Notify me about replies to threads I'm following" -> You'll still receive unread threads alert within the app but you won't receive distracting notifications on desktop.
* Sidebar optimization: Create sections for unimportant/muted channels and move these sections to the bottom (Below DMs.)

* For Sections that are unimportant: Click on individual sections and set them to show "Mentions only"

* Set notifications to display as a persistent banner instead of auto-dismissed alerts: this ensures all your critical messages are "Sticky" - after configuring all the changes listed here, you'll only see critical notifications and you don't want them to be auto-dismissed.

* Hardcore dev mode: Preferences -> Accessibility -> Simplified Layout Mode


# Alt-Tab app
* Override mac app switcher by setting Alt-Tab shortcut to command instead of ctrl
* Add Slack, Spotify and other non-essential apps to blacklists -> App switcher only shows what you really need for work -> You can still open/switch to these apps using Raycast or Spotlight. The added friction stops you from feeding your doom App-switching impulses
* Set controls to only display windows from Current Space, Hide hidden windows
